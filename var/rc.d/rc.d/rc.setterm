# This file provides the command line for the setterm utility to set the
# terminal attributes (primarily used for screen blanking and power
# management).

# Screen blanks after 15 minutes idle time, and powers down in one hour
# if the kernel supports APM or ACPI power management (default setting):
/bin/setterm -blank 15 -powersave powerdown -powerdown 60

# Screen does not blank or use power management features:
#/bin/setterm -blank 0 -powersave off -powerdown 0
